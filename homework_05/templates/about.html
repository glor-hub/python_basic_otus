    <p>  Horoscope is an Old English word whose origin is Greek.
        The Greek words “hora”, for time, and “skopos”, for observer, combine to identify a “time observer”.
        More accurately, the word horoscope describes the observation of the timing of the sky, which is something synonymous with the word “Zodiac”.
